"""Validate MS-SMC' solutions for waiting distances to tree/topo changes.

The main function (simulate) takes a species tree and other parameters
as input and simulates tree sequences under the specified species tree.
For each tree sequence the first genealogy is sampled (tree0). We then
sample until the first topology-change event occurs to find tree1. This
is treated as our true starting tree. (This tweak was made after finding
that the distance from the init tree in a tskit tree-sequence until the
next recomb event is anomalous compared to all other waiting distances,
so we instead start fresh from the next topology change.)
From here, we calculate the probabilities of events and record the 
observed recombination events to the next tree or topology.

The final results is saved as .npy (ndarray) and written to the current
directory where this script is run.
