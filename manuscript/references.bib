  abstract = {The ancestral recombination graph is a structure that describes the joint genealogies of sampled DNA sequences along the genome. Recent computational methods have made impressive progress toward scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring the ancestral recombination graph, some of these methods can also provide ancestral recombination graphs sampled from a defined posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ancestral recombination graphs is crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating population genetic parameters such as effective population size, mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use standard neutral coalescent simulations to benchmark the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from 3 popular ancestral recombination graph inference programs: ARGweaver, Relate, and tsinfer+tsdate. We compare (1) the true coalescence times to the inferred times at each locus; (2) the distribution of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential distribution; (3) whether the sampled coalescence times have the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We find that inferred coalescence times at each locus are most accurate in ARGweaver, and often more accurate in Relate than in tsinfer+tsdate. However, all 3 methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate large ones. Lastly, the posterior distribution of ARGweaver is closer to the expected posterior distribution than Relate’s, but this higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability. The best choice of method will depend on the number and length of input sequences and on the goal of downstream analyses, and we provide guidelines for the best practices.},

The overarching goal of the volume is to increase the visibility and use of these new methods by the entire phylogenetic community by specifically addressing several challenges: (i) firm understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the methodology, (ii) empirical examples demonstrating the utility of the methodology as well as its limitations, and (iii) attention to technical aspects involved in the actual software implementation of the methodology. As such, this volume will not only be poised to become the quintessential guide to training the next generation of researchers, but it will also be instrumental in ushering in a new phylogenetic paradigm for the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Reticulate evolution, whether due to lateral gene transfer, introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, or hybrid speciation, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, yet systematists have few tools for analyzing and summarizing the resulting genealogical discordance. Here I argue that a primary concordance tree, a tree built from clades that are true of a plurality of the genome, provides a useful summary of the dominant phylogenetic history for a group of organisms. Residual historical signals can also be extracted in the form of secondary, tertiary, etc. concordance trees, which are built from clades that are present in the genome but contradict clades on the primary concordance tree. Clades on concordance trees can be annotated with their concordance factor (CF), the proportion of the genome for which the clade is true. Concordance trees can potentially be estimated either from population histories or from multilocus molecular datasets. In the latter case one can use the recently developed Bayesian concordance analysis to obtain point estimates and credibility intervals on CF's. I argue that the concepts of concordance trees and concordance factors inform the debate on how to integrate information from multiple independent datasets and help clarify the nature of the boundary between reticulate and divergent genealogy.},

Furthermore, understanding the demographic histories of other species is playing an increasingly important role in conservation genetics. A number of statistical methods have been developed to infer population demographic histories using whole-genome sequence data, with recent advances focusing on allowing for more flexible modeling choices, scaling to larger data sets, and increasing statistical power. Here we review coalescent hidden Markov models, a powerful class of population genetic inference methods that can utilize linkage disequilibrium information effectively. We highlight recent advances, give advice for practitioners, point out potential pitfalls, and present possible future research directions.},

In particular, the waiting distance between tree changes along the genome can be used to make inference about the distribution and evolution of recombination rates. To this end, we here derive an analytic expression for the distribution of waiting distances between tree changes under the sequentially Markovian coalescent model and obtain an accurate approximation to the distribution of waiting distances for topology changes. We use these results to show that some of the recently proposed methods for inferring sequences of trees along the genome provide strongly biased distributions of waiting distances. In addition, we provide a correction to an undercounting problem facing all available ARG inference methods, thereby facilitating the use of ARG inference methods to estimate temporal changes in the recombination rate.},

  abstract = {Toytree is a lightweight Python library for programmatically visualizing and manipulating tree-based data structures. It implements a minimalist design aesthetic and modern plotting architecture suited for interactive coding in IPython/Jupyter. Tree drawings are generated in HTML using the toyplot library backend, and display natively in Jupyter notebooks with interactivity features. Tree drawings can be combined with other plotting functions from the toyplot library (e.g. scatterplots, histograms) to create composite figures on a shared coordinate grid, and can be exported to additional formats including PNG, PDF and SVG. To parse and store tree data, toytree uses a modified fork of the ete3 TreeNode object, which includes functions for manipulating, annotating and comparing trees. Toytree integrates these functions with a plotting layout to allow node values to be extracted from trees in the correct order to style nodes for plotting. In addition, toytree provides functions for parsing additional tree formats, generating random trees, inferring consensus trees and drawing grids or clouds from multiple trees to visualize discordance. The goal of toytree is to provide a simple Python equivalent to commonly used tree manipulation and plotting libraries in R, and in doing so, to promote further development of phylogenetic and other tree-based methods in Python. Toytree is released under the GPLv3 license. Source code is available on GitHub and documentation is available at https://toytree.readthedocs.io.},

Whereas the MSC explicitly assumes genealogies to be unlinked, i.e., statistically independent, genealogies located close together on genomes are spatially auto-correlated. Here we use tree sequence simulations with recombination to explore the effects of species tree parameters on spatial patterns of linkage among genealogies. We decompose coalescent time units to demonstrate differential effects of generation time and effective population size on spatial coalescent patterns, and we define a new metric, "phylogenetic linkage," for measuring the rate of decay of phylogenetic similarity by comparison to distances among unlinked genealogies. Finally, we provide a simple example where accounting for phylogenetic linkage in sliding window analyses improves local gene tree inference.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure and the tskit library. We summarize msprime’s many features, and show that its performance is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized alternatives. These high-performance features have been thoroughly tested and validated, and built using a collaborative, open source development model, which reduces duplication of effort and promotes software quality via community engagement.},

  abstract = {Histories of sequences in the coalescent model with recombination can be simulated using an algorithm that takes as input a sample of extant sequences. The algorithm traces the history of the sequences going back in time, encountering recombinations and coalescence (duplications) until the ancestral material is located on one sequence for homologous positions in the present sequences. Here an alternative algorithm is formulated not as going back in time and operating on sequences, but by moving spatially along the sequences, updating the history of the sequences as recombination points are encountered. This algorithm focuses on spatial aspects of the coalescent with recombination rather than on temporal aspects as is the case of familiar algorithms. Mathematical results related to spatial aspects of the coalescent with recombination are derived.},
